                <h2> Son: Jack John Christopher Depp III</h2>
                Johnny’s and Vanessa’s son Jack John Christopher was born April 9th, 2002 in a hospital near
                Paris.Johnny Christopher “Jack” Depp III, the son of Johnny Depp, born to French singer/actress Vanessa
                Paradis, has largely remained out of the limelight for much of his life. Jack was born to the pair when
                they were together for 14 years between 1998 and 2012.

                Now, a photo of the youngster has emerged on social media finally giving the world a glimpse of the
                Hollywood star's lesser-known son, and his similarity to Johnny is striking.

                The youngster appeared in a photograph on an Instagram fan account, with his hands raised in the air and
                the famous Los-Angeles Hollywood sign begind him. And Jack looks very similar to his 57-year-old iconic
                father.Unlike Jack, his sister Lily-Rose Depp followed in the footsteps of their father and is an
                accomplished actress herself.

                Johnny and Vanessa met in 1998 and dated for a number of years, during which time, the couple welcomed
                Lily-Rose and Jack. More recently, Vanessa came out in support of Johnny and defended him in court after
                his ex-wife Amber Heard accused him of domestic violence.

                For the unversed, Amber was married to Depp from 2015 and 2017. Their divorce became a subject of
                international media attention, with the actress alleging that Depp had been abusive through most of
                their relationship.

                Depp I. Bob died around 2000. She was emplyed as a waitress when Johnny was growing up. Now she does not
                have to work at all, which is the way Johnny wants it!! He has spoken about this numerous times. He saw
                her work her fingers to the bone to provide a life for her children and now she can relax. Johnny has a
                tattoo with Betty Sue’s name. Unfortunately, she died 20. Mai 2016..Palmer’s death came days before
                Depp’s wife, Amber Heard, filed for divorce after 15 months of marriage. The actress, who filed a
                divorce petition on Monday, is asking for spousal support from Depp, 52, according to documents obtained
                by PEOPLE.

                Depp had an especially close relationship with his mother, who was a frequent guest of the actor at
                various Hollywood functions over the years. In 2004, Palmer accompanied her son to the Academy Awards
                when he was nominated for best actor for his role in Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black
                Pearl.

                In 2012, Palmer was reportedly admitted to the ICU at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. And in
                2014, Depp was spotted taking Palmer and Heard out for New Year’s Eve dinner. “It was obvious that
                Johnny was at dinner with his two favorite ladies,” an observer at Ago Restaurant in West Hollywood told
                PEOPLE at the time. “He seemed very, very happy.”

                I.John Christopher Depp was married to Betty Sue Palmer, with whom he was blessed with three children.
                As Johnny Depp’s father was a civil engineer, falling in love with someone from a different sector was
                very rare back in the day.John Christopher Depp was mostly absent in his son’s upbringing. Pic Source:

                Palmer. John Christopher’s ex-wife was diagnosed with cancer in 2013 and passed away in 2016. Their son,
                Johnny Depp, had both positive as well as negative words for her at her funeral.Johnny Depp’s father
                John Christopher Depp earned his name for his public works rather than being an engineer. After working

                as you have the opportunity to breathe, breathe. As long as you have the opportunity to make your kid
                smile and laugh, and move it forward."

                Some great words by Johnny Depp, who takes his role as a parent very seriously. In truth, his youth was
                a difficult one, he constantly moved and his relationship alongside his parents was a troubled one.
