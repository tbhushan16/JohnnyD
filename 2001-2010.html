                <p>Blow is a 2001 American biographical crime film, directed by Ted Demme, about American cocaine
                    smuggler George Jung. David McKenna and Nick Cassavetes adapted Bruce Porter's 1993 book Blow: How a
                    Small Town Boy Made $100 Million with the Medellín Cocaine Cartel and Lost It All[2] for the
                    screenplay. It is based on the real-life stories of George Jung, Pablo Escobar, Carlos Lehder Rivas
                    (portrayed in the film as Diego Delgado), and the Medellín Cartel. The film's title comes from a
                    slang term for cocaine.

                    Blow was the final theatrical film directed by Demme to be released in his lifetime.</p>
